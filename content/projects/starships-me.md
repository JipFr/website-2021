Starships is a blog I built to try out new technologies. It's built with Nuxt/Vue and Sanity.

The blog is about starships in sci-fi. That includes TV shows like Star Trek, The Mandalorian, and The Orville, but also movies such as Star Wars. 

I wanted to try out a new technology, so I thought I'd try out Sanity: it was a perfect fit.

The website is available at [starships.me](https://starships.me)
