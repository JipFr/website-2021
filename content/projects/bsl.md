BSL (or boodschappenlijst in Dutch, it's very creative) is a web app designed to be used in families. Used the synced list to easily put your wishes on the list, which can then be viewed by whoever is doing the shopping.

This project is available at [bsl.jipfr.nl](bsl.jipfr.nl). However, you need an account to use it. Shoot me an e-mail!
